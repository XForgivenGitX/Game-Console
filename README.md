# GameConsole
## Dynamic button processing
The library counts down the time of a possible rattle and notifies about the status of the button in the LogicState enumeration. It is also possible to count the sequence of clicks / holds and read the finished series.
## Tools
- microcontroller STM32F103
- display ILI9341
- AdafruitGFX library
All this is combined in the DSO Shell 150 modules I use.
### Games that have been implemented so far: 
- Tetris
- Snake
